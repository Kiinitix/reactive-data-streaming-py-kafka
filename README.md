## Use Cases:
- Brand Monitoring and Crisis Management: Companies can use this solution to monitor social media in real time. If thereâ€™s negative sentiment, the system can immediately flag these tweets for the customer support or PR team to handle the issue proactively, reducing the risk of brand damage.
- Customer Feedback Analysis: Businesses can track customer feedback in real time to assess satisfaction. Positive feedback can lead to rewards or recognition, while negative feedback triggers support interventions.
- Political Sentiment Tracking: This system can track mentions of political figures, companies, or events in real-time, enabling real-time sentiment analysis during speeches, news events, or crises.
- Stock Market Prediction: Investors could use this to track sentiment towards companies and brands, using social media sentiment as part of their strategy for predicting stock movements.

## Further Enhancements:
- Alert System Integration: You could integrate email or SMS notifications for critical alerts.
- Data Storage: Store the processed tweets and their sentiments in a database for historical analysis.
- Dashboarding: Create real-time visualizations (using Power BI, Grafana, etc.) of the sentiment score trends.
